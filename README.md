The Poker Circles app simplifies organizing and tracking cash games for poker nights. Whether you're hosting a game or playing, the app ensures smooth management of buy-ins, chip distributions, and cash-outs. Bankers (hosts) can create sessions, approve player requests, and finalize settlements, while players can join games, request buy-ins, and cash out seamlessly. With real-time updates and automatic profit/loss calculations, the app eliminates paperwork and disputes, making poker nights more enjoyable and transparent.

Designed for both casual home games and serious poker groups, the app keeps everything in one place—player lists, chip values, and transaction history. Bankers maintain full control over the game flow, while players can track their spending and winnings effortlessly. No more manual tracking or confusion—just a fair, organized, and stress-free poker experience for everyone involved.
